# goit-js-hw-06

This project was developed to further deepen practical JavaScript skills by implementing dynamic and interactive functionality within a static HTML context, as part of the GoIT Fullstack Developer curriculum.

Aligned with essential frontend development and JavaScript principles:

- JavaScript is used extensively to manipulate DOM elements, manage events, and implement interactive logic based on user input.
- All script files are organized within a `js/` directory to encourage modular code organization and separation of concerns.
- Standard coding conventions are applied to enhance readability and maintainability, including descriptive naming of functions and consistent formatting.
- The project focuses on vanilla JavaScript techniques without reliance on external libraries, fostering a solid understanding of core language features.
- The HTML structure is designed to provide a semantic foundation that supports the dynamic behaviors implemented via JavaScript.

This repository represents the sixth assignment in the GoIT JavaScript module and demonstrates practical application of scripting, DOM interaction, and event‑driven logic in a client‑side environment.
